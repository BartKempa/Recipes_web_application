   git clone https://github.com/BartKempa/recipes.git
   cd recipes
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:
   ```env
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=recipes
   DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=pass
   SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=yourGoogleClientId
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=yourGoogleClientSecret
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=password to your mailbox
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
5. Visit the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Option 2: Using IDE (developer profile)

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g. IntelliJ)
2. Make sure the `dev` profile is active (H2 in-memory DB)
3. Create a `secret.properties` file in the resources directory with the following content:
```env
spring.mail.password=password to your mailbox
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=yourGoogleClientId
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=yourGoogleClientSecre

```
4. Run the application from your IDE
5. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
